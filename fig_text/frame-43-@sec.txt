Searching. The green UAV is surrounded by 0 red UAV (enemy) and 1 blue UAV (teammate). 1 teammate is engaged in searching. Since no enemy forces have been detected and no teammates are escaping or chasing, the green UAV should perform a searching mission and use a trajectory prediction algorithm to generate the most likely target points where the enemy might appear.
